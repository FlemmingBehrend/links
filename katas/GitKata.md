# GitKata

This kata is an exercise in working with the most used git commands.

##Before you start: 
 * Create an empty directory somewhere on your local computer.

##Git

* Create a new git repository (initialize)
* Configure the newly created repository with [name=John] and [email=johndoe@email.com]
* Create John's faviorite recipe in a file called `PastaWithGreenOlives.txt`  
```INI
250g orecchiette  
3 tablespoons olive oil  
2 cloves of	garlic  
8 tablespoons passata  
```
* Add the recipe to John's repository with the following message `John's recipe`  
  * Check that the correct user and email is used in the commit (hint: log) 
* You forgot the olives, in a new branch called `add-olives` add the following line to `PasteWithGreenOlives.txt`
```INI
1 x 150	g jar of green olives
```
* Create a new commit with the following message `John Doe's updated recipe`
* You forgot to add John's last name to the first commit message, go change it to `John Doe's recipe`
* Your changes need to go into the master branch without creating a merge commit (hint: rebase)
