# GitKata

This kata is an exercise in working with the most used git commands.

##Before you start: 
 * Create an empty directory somewhere on your local computer.

##Git

1. Create a new git repository (initialize)
2. Configure the newly created repository with [name=John] and [email=johndoe@email.com]
3. Create John's faviorite recipe in a file called `PastaWithGreenOlives.txt`

> 250g orecchiette  
> 3 tablespoons olive oil  
> 2 cloves of	garlic  
> 8 tablespoons passata  

4. Add the recipe to John's repository with the following message `John's recipe`
5. You forgot the olives, in a new branch called `AddOlives` add the following line to `PasteWithGreenOlives.txt`

> 1 x 150	g jar of green olives

6. Create a new commit with the following message `John Doe's updated recipe`
7. You forgot to add John's last name to the first commit message, go change it to `John Doe's recipe`
8. Your changes need to go into the master branch without creating a merge commit (hint: rebase)
